## Introducing myself ‚úå
My name is ***Batool***, an ***electrical engineering*** graduate from ***Mutah University***.
> I shifted to web development because I found it to be a more suitable challenge for me; a challenge where hopefully I'll be willing to prove myself.

### Interests ‚ù§
- #### Reading üíï
I enjoy reading very much, in fact here are some of my favorite novels: 
1. Crime and Punishment Novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky
2. The Unbearable Lightness of Being Novel by Milan Kundera
3. The Metamorphosis Novel by Franz Kafka

- #### Listening to Music üíï
I absolutely love music, especially progressive metal, which can be defined as
: a broad fusion music genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock, combining the loud "aggression" and amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or "pseudo-classical" compositions of the latter.
